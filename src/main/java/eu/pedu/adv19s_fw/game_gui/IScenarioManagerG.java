/*******************************************************************************
 * Instances of the {@code IScenarioManagerG} interface serve as
 * scenario managers that have to manage the scenarios of the associated game.
 * These scenarios should allow to test and demonstrate
 * the functionality of the associated game.
 * <p>
 * Each manager has to offer:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The <b>happy scenario</b> (the basic successful one)
 *     demonstrating certain successful path through the game possibilities
 *     leading to the game goal.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>The <b>mistake scenario</b>
 *     demonstrating the game reaction to the wrongly entered commands.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Individual managed scenarios have to differ by their names;
 * the names of the happy scenario and the mistake one
 * are firmly pre-determined and cannot be arbitrarily set.
 * <p>
 * Individual scenarios are iterable and "streamable" sequences of steps
 * specified by instances of the framework class
 * {@link eu.pedu.adv19s_fw.scenario.ScenarioStep},
 * to which the designed game should associated.
 * <p>
 * Scenario manager should be a singleton, that is responsible
 * for all scenarios concerning the game associated with it.
